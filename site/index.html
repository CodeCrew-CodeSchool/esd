                In this activity, you will find four flags (and an optional bonus flag) hidden somewhere within the
                website. Each flag will include a random word. Keep track of the random words. You will submit all words
                in the next item.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. The first flag is hidden in the site's source code. Use the View Page Source feature to find it. If
                your right-click is disabled, copy and paste this into your web browser:
            <p id="viewsource">
                href="view-source:https://CodeCrew-CodeSchool.github.io/esd/site" onclick="copyViewSource(event)"
                title="Click to Copy">
                view-source:https://CodeCrew-CodeSchool.github.io/esd/site
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. In the source code, there is a <strong>style.css</strong> file. Search this file for the second flag.
                Take note of the web address of this file. How is it different than the original website?
            </p>
            <p>
                3. In the source code, there is also a <strong>script.js</strong> file. Search this file for the third
                flag. Look at the web address here as well. What is the only part of the address that is different in
                each file?
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Lastly, there is another file that is NOT listed on the website or in the source code. You can only
                access this file by typing it in the web address bar. To find this file, unscramble the following word
                and place it in the web address in the format shown:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unscramble this word: eteceditv</li>
                <li>Use the following format to navigate to the hidden file. Replace the blank before <code>.txt</code>
                    with the unscrambled word and go to that site:</li>
                <li>https://code-crew.org/___________.txt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                5. Advanced Bonus Flag (Optional): Right-click on the image of the cat and save the file to your
                desktop.
                Open the file with a text editor (either <strong>Notepad</strong> on a Windows computer or
                <strong>TextEdit</strong> on a Mac). Find the bonus flag!
